Welcome to IS382! Couple of important notes as you get started:

* Complete this [Google Form](`r formative_assessment`) as soon as possible. I will use some of the data (in aggregate) in the meetup.

* [Join the Slack channel by clicking here](`r slack_invite_link`) (or use your @sps.cuny.edu email address). This will be our primary mode of communication. 

* For private communications, you can either send private Slack messages or email me at [`r instructor_email`](mailto:`r paste0(instructor_email, '?subject=', course)`).

* Complete the self-regulated learning assessment in DAACS. Visit [cuny.daacs.net](https://cuny.daacs.net) and sign-in using your CUNY acocunt.

* Our Meetups will be on XXX from X:00pm to X:00pm. **I expect everyone to attend or watch the Meetups.** Important information will be shared during the meetups that will not be available in any other format.

I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!
