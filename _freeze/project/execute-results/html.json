You are to use a statistical procedure from this class (i.e. null hypothesis test). There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided below. Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website so should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis.\n\n## Grading Rubric\n\n\n\n\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Domain </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Accomplished </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proficient </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Needs Improvement </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Abstract </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Abstract is less than 300 words, free of grammatical errors, summarizes the analysis conducted, has a conclusion and implicaitons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Introduction </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The research question is clearly stated, can be answered by the data, and the context of the problem clearly explained. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The research question is unclear and/or not supported by the data. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Research question is ambiguous, unclear, or not stated. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Data Display </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Includes appropriate, well-labeled, accurate displays (graphs and tables) of the data. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Includes appropriate, accurate displays of the data. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Includes appropriate but no accurate displays of the data. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Data Analysis </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The appropriate statistical test(s) was used for the data and interpretation was clear. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The appropriate statistical test(s) was used but interpretation was not fully clear or well articulated. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The incorrect statistical test was used an/or not justified for the data as presented. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Conclusion </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Conclusion includes a clear answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data analysis and the method of data collection. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Conclusion includes an answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data but not with the data collection method. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Conclusion does not include an answer to the statistical question that is consistent with the data analysis. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Overall Presentation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Attractive, well-organized, well-written presentation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Presentation has two of the three qualities: attractive, well-organized, well-written. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Presentation is not attractive, organized, or written.

If not, provide a citation/link.\n* Response: What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?\n* Explanatory: What is the explanatory variable(s), and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?\n* Relevant summary statistics\n* What statistical test will you perform?\n\n## Final Project\n\nChecklist / Suggested Outline\n\n* Overview slide\n\t* Context on the data collection\n\t* Description of the dependent variable (what is being measured)\n\t* Description of the independent variable (what is being measured; include at least 2 variables)\n\t* Research question\n* Summary statistics\n* Include appropriate data visualizations.\n* Statistical output\n\t* Include the appropriate statistics for your method used.\n\t* For null hypothesis tests (e.g. t-test, chi-squared, ANOVA, etc.), state the null and alternative hypotheses along with relevant statistic and p-value (and confidence interval if appropriate).\n* Conclusion\n\t* Why is this analysis important?\n\t* Limitations of the analysis?\n\n\n## Example Data Sources\n\nYou are not to use data sources used in class or the textbooks.
