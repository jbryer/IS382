Topics cover parametric (e.g. regression), non-parametric (e.g. classification and regression trees), and Bayesian models for predicting quantitative and qualitative outcomes.\n\n\nPROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES ADDRESSED BY THIS COURSE:\n\n\nDescribe how information is collected, stored, managed, classified, retrieved, and disseminated\nAnalyze data to solve problems in practical scenarios\nApply skills used to program applications, manage systems, and protect data in complex/heterogeneous computing environments\nApply analytical and statistical methods to retrieve, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data for decision-making\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:\n\nEffectively use R for conducting analysis, creating reports, and presenting results.\nEstimate predictive models using both parametric and non-parametric models.\nCommunicate the accuracy of predictive models using a variety of fit statistics.\nHave strategies for handling missing data in the predictive modeling pipeline.\nEffectively communicate the results of a predictive models.\n\n\n\nREQUIRED TEXTBOOKS:\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin. Available for free at https://openintro-ims.netlify.app\nIntroduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R 2nd Edition by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trever Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. Available for free at https://www.statlearning.com\nFeature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. Available for free at https://bookdown.org/max/FES/\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Freely available at https://r4ds.had.co.nz\n\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\nR Software – Download from https://cran.r-project.org\nRStudio Desktop – Download from https://posit.co/downloads/\nWindows users should also download and install RTools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\nMac users should also download and install Xcode and gfortran. Directions are available here: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/\n\n\n\nASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:\nData Project (25% Total; Proposal 5%, Final Presentation 20%)\nThe purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a reproducible analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example LASTNAME-Proposal.Rmd and LASTNAME-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website, so they should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis.\nLabs (50%): R is the statistical software you will use for this course. The labs aim to provide an opportunity for you to apply your statistical content knowledge in the context of problems to solve in R, thus also providing you the opportunity to practice and become familiar with the R platform and language. The labs will be guided; thus, step-by-step procedures will be laid out for you to follow in order to get the desired outputs. Interpretations of results are just as important as the results themselves, so once you have the results, interpret them in the context of the problems. Labs are graded based on completion, accuracy, and thoroughness of results and interpretations.\nFinal Exam (15%): Exams will consist of conceptual, computational, and application questions, an include a combination of multiple choice, short response questions, as well as a data analysis task. The exams will focus on the material covered during the course of the semester. More detail will be provided about the material assessed by each exam closer in time to the actual exams. It should be noted that most of the statistical skills acquired during this class are constantly building upon earlier learning. This means that even though each exam will focus on the preceding section of the course, students might need to recall skills learned in earlier sections.\nParticipation (10%): While attendance at synchronous meetups is not required, it is highly encouraged that you do attend: this is where you can ask questions, participate in-situ, and engage with your professor and peers. In addition, announcements and updates relating to coursework will be reviewed during these meetups. With that said, we understand that extenuating circumstances might not allow some of you to attend. Thus, we have built-in diagnostic and weekly formative assessment assignments that will give us an understanding of your current level of knowledge and lingering gaps in knowledge to be completed after attending or watching the recording of every meetup.\nYou will receive full points upon completion of each of these assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Assignments\nPoints or Percentage of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nParticipation/ Weekly Formative Assessments\n10%\n\n\nProject Proposal\n5%\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation\n20%\n\n\nLabs / Weekly Assignments\n50%\n\n\nFinal Exam\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY SPS UNDERGRAD GRADING SCALE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nRanges %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nA\n93 - 100\n4.0\n\n\nA-\n90 - &lt; 92\n3.7\n\n\nB+\n87 - &lt; 90\n3.3\n\n\nB\n83 - &lt; 87\n3.0\n\n\nB-\n80 - &lt; 83\n2.7\n\n\nC+\n77 - &lt; 80\n2.3\n\n\nC\n73 - &lt; 77\n2.0\n\n\nC-\n70 - &lt; 73\n1.7\n\n\nD\n60 - &lt; 70\n1.0\n\n\nF\n&lt; 60\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE AND SCHEDULE\nSubject to change\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n1\nIntroduction to the course \n\n\n2\nIntroduction to Modeling \n\n\n3\nLinear regression \n\n\n4\nMultiple regression \n\n\n5\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation and Logistic Regression\n\n\n6\nGenerative Models for Classification\n\n\n7\nResampling Methods\n\n\n8\nTree Based Methods\n\n\n9\nBagging and Random Forests\n\n\n10\nSupport Vector Machines\n\n\n11\nPrincipal Component Analysis\n\n\n12\nClustering Methods\n\n\n13\nMissing data \n\n\n14\nBayesian Analysis\n\n\n15\nWrap up / Final Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS\nThe CUNY School of Professional Studies is committed to making higher education accessible to students with disabilities by removing architectural barriers and providing programs and support services necessary for them to benefit from the instruction and resources of the University.

Be sure to install R and RStudio on your own computers within the first few days of the class.\n\nR - download for Windows, Mac, or Linux.\nRStudio - Download Windows, Mac, or Linux versions from here\n\nIf using Windows, you also need to download RTools.\n\n\nLaTeX\n\nLaTeX is a typesetting language for preparing documents. Documents are written in plain text files. Formatting the document is done using specific markup. If you have used HTML, the framework is similar however instead of using &lt;TAG&gt;&lt;/TAG&gt; syntax, LaTeX uses \\TAG{} format. We will primarily use Markdown, and its extension R Markdown for preparing documents in this class. However, when preparing PDF documents, the Markdown will first be converted to LaTeX before creating the PDF file. As such, a LaTeX converter is necessary. There are LaTeX installers for Windows (MiKTeX) and Mac (BasicTeX). Alternatively, the tinytex R package provides an easier way of installing LaTeX directly from within R:\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\n\n\nR Packages\n\nOnce everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):\n\ninstall.packages(c('openintro','devtools','tidyverse', 'ggplot2',\n                   'psych','reshape2','knitr','markdown','shiny','R.rsp',\n                   'fivethirtyeight'))\nremotes::install_github(\"jbryer/DATA606\")\nremotes::install_github(\"jbryer/VisualStats\")\n\n\n\nSource Control\nAll course materials will be made available on Github which provides an implementation of the git open source version control system. RStudio supports git directly. For more information, Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and Github for the useR is a free online book covering the important features of source control for R users.",
